## Overview

### Standard Library Functions (Section ยง3.1)


| Description | Proof-of-concept attack | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| C++ authenticated encryption with associated data in Sancus. | / | / |
| VatiCAN code is offline now, a zipped folder can be found here. | / | / |
| The vulnerable VRASED function and an attack can be found in the secure_cmp folder. | [secure_memcmp](secure_memcmp/) | [VRASED+](https://github.com/sprout-uci/vrased-plus/issues/1), [TRAIN](https://github.com/sprout-uci/TRAIN/issues/1), [ACFA](https://github.com/RIT-CHAOS-SEC/ACFA/issues/1), [RATA](https://github.com/sprout-uci/RATA/issues/1), and [SpecCFA](https://github.com/RIT-CHAOS-SEC/SpecCFA/issues/1) |


### Compiler Analysis (Section ยง3.2)

| Description | Proof-of-concept attack | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| The code used for analysing compilers can be found in the compiler-equal folder. To ease the artifact evaluation you can use Godbolt for different compilers e.g.: [MSP430 gcc 14.2.0](https://godbolt.org/z/b63qf4T76) or [RISC-V gcc 14.2.0](https://godbolt.org/z/oqvhKPh7M). | [compiler-equal](compiler-equal/) | / |
| Vulnerable LeiA code. | / | [LeiA](https://github.com/MoatazFarid/Lightweight-Authentication-Protocol-for-CAN-LeiA/issues/1) |
| VulCAN is vulnerable in two places. | / | [VulCAN](https://github.com/sancus-tee/vulcan/issues/9) |

### Hardware Timing Vulnerability (Section ยง3.3)

| Description | Proof-of-concept attack | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| Sancus' cryptographic unit is vulnerable. | [unwrap-break](unwrap-break/) | [Sancus](https://github.com/sancus-tee/sancus-core/issues/34) |
| An end-to-end attack on the Authentic Execution framework is performed.  | [auth-ex-break](auth-ex-break/) | / |

### Hardware Mitigation (Section ยง4.3)

Two patches for the vulnerable Sancus core are provided in the [mitigations](mitigations/) folder. Changes are in comparison to the latest [commit](https://github.com/sancus-tee/sancus-core/blob/d83a5207dc5b079847dba39ac17e98fcb4bc088f).
