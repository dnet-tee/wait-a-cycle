[![Build Status](https://github.com/dnet-tee/wait-a-cycle/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dnet-tee/wait-a-cycle/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains the artifacts accompanying our [paper](https://downloads.distrinet-research.be/software/sancus/publications/vandijck25wait.pdf) "Wait a Cycle: Eroding Cryptographic Trust in Low-End TEEs via Timing Side Channels" to appear at the 8th Workshop on System Software for Trusted Execution.

Artifacts and repositories relevant to the findings in the paper can be found here. For more information about mitigations we suggest to look at the issues submitted to the affected repositories.

## Overview

### Standard Library Functions (Section ยง3.1)


| Description | Proof-of-concept attack | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| C++ authenticated encryption with associated data in Sancus. | / | [sancus-compiler](https://github.com/sancus-tee/sancus-compiler/issues/42), [authentic execution](https://github.com/AuthenticExecution/spongent-cpp-rs/issues/1) |
| VatiCAN code is offline now, a zipped folder can be found here. | / | see /vatican-1.1/vatican/src/vatican.cpp#L.169 |
| The vulnerable VRASED function and an attack can be found in the secure_cmp folder. The results of this attack (Wait a Cycle: table 5) can be reproduced using the proof-of-concept attack. | [secure_memcmp](secure_memcmp/) | [VRASED+](https://github.com/sprout-uci/vrased-plus/issues/1), [TRAIN](https://github.com/sprout-uci/TRAIN/issues/1), [ACFA](https://github.com/RIT-CHAOS-SEC/ACFA/issues/1), [RATA](https://github.com/sprout-uci/RATA/issues/1), and [SpecCFA](https://github.com/RIT-CHAOS-SEC/SpecCFA/issues/1) |


### Compiler Analysis (Section ยง3.2)

| Description | Proof-of-concept | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| The code used for analysing compilers can be found in the compiler-equal folder. To ease the artifact evaluation you can use Godbolt for different compilers (Wait a Cycle: listing 2, listing 3 and table 2): [MSP430 gcc 14.2.0](https://godbolt.org/z/b63qf4T76), [RISC-V gcc 14.2.0](https://godbolt.org/z/oqvhKPh7M), [MIPS (el) gcc 14.2.0](https://godbolt.org/z/7ffT77oMf) and [x86 msvc v19](https://godbolt.org/z/fYY8Phx9z). | [compiler-equal](compiler-equal/) | / |
| Vulnerable LeiA code. | / | [LeiA](https://github.com/MoatazFarid/Lightweight-Authentication-Protocol-for-CAN-LeiA/issues/1) |
| VulCAN is vulnerable in two places. | / | [VulCAN](https://github.com/sancus-tee/vulcan/issues/9) |

### Hardware Timing Vulnerability (Section ยง3.3)

| Description | Proof-of-concept attack | Issue |
|-----------------|---------------|:-------------:|
| Sancus' cryptographic unit is vulnerable (Wait a Cycle: figure 1 and table 3). | [unwrap-break](unwrap-break/) | [Sancus](https://github.com/sancus-tee/sancus-core/issues/34) |
| An end-to-end attack on the Authentic Execution framework is performed.  | [auth-ex-break](auth-ex-break/) | / |

### Hardware Mitigation (Section ยง4.3)

Two patches for the vulnerable Sancus core are provided in the [mitigations](mitigations/) folder. Changes are in comparison to the latest [commit](https://github.com/sancus-tee/sancus-core/blob/d83a5207dc5b079847dba39ac17e98fcb4bc088f). See section 4.3 in the paper for a full overview of the comparison and figure 2 and 3 for a graphical representation.


## Building and Running

The expected output can be viewed in the [GitHub Actions CI environment](https://github.com/dnet-tee/wait-a-cycle/actions).

To run the proof-of-concepts yourself in the cycle-accurate Sancus openMSP430 simulator in a Docker environment, proceed as follows:

```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/sancus-tee/sancus-main/sancus-devel-64:latest
$ docker run -it -v .:/sancus/wait-a-cycle ghcr.io/sancus-tee/sancus-main/sancus-devel-64:latest
========================================================================
= Sancus development Docker container                                  =
